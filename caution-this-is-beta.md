# Semantic Synchrony is evolving!

If you start using Semantic Synchrony now, and you want to keep up with the code as it evolves, you will need to upgrade your knowledge base at least once, because breaking changes lie ahead. We will publish guides on how to do that, and offer help on [gitter](http://www.gitter.com/synchrony), the issue trackers on [github](http://www.github.com/synchrony), and [Facebook](facebook.com/semanticsynchrony/).

The things you learn in Semantic Synchrony now will never go away, and will never become more complicated. However, more features will appear. For instance, we are working on using markdown instead of plain text, because it allows for within-text links (to other parts of the graph, or to the internet), multi-line text entries, section headings, and labeled relationships.
