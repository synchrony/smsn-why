## Peace, expression, and Semantic Synchrony

All human information-processing states are valid -- stillness, observation, memory, imagination, expression (writing), search (reading), sharing.

# meditation as inner stillness

Meditation is sometimes described as inner stillness, a peace, a restful state of pure perception, without words, perhaps even without the self.

That inner stillness is real, and available -- and it fits in a bigger context of Semantic Synchrony user experiences.

# shades of expression

Sometimes we use words, and sometimes we don't, and both states are valid. And really it's more than "both" -- in the mind there is a whole spectrum of expression. Sometime we perceive objects, feelings, implications, or memories, without putting them into words. (Sometimes perception does not even get that far: we might detect aspects of something, without integrating the aspects into a "thing" to recognize.)

The transition of a perception from nonverbalized to verbalized is a learnable, mutable skill. It is possible, for instance, through self-awareness and investigation, to overcome a habit of prejudice. Simple study transforms the self.

# benefits of (verbal) expression

Expressing something in words makes it easier to remember and process. Short, concise expressions are particularly easy to remember. That is part of why condensing your notes is a good learning strategy.

Somewhat opposite to that, expression also makes it easier to let go of something. The unresolved feeling after an awkward encounter, for instance, can be a subconscious call to action: "Something went wrong, behavioral change needed, there is something to figure out." Identify the problem, put it into words, and you will find greater peace.

Once an idea is expressed in words, it can be recorded, and grouped with other expressions. It might be a waste of time to record every idea, but equally, it is a waste of ideas to record none of them.

# fluidity, humility, and detachment

Sometimes there is a goal, and sometimes there is none. Sometiomes the goal is simply to feel. Sometimes it is to express and record; sometimes it is to read, discover and use information from yourself and others. What you have written, and what exists on the internet, are both valid objects of inquiry, and Semantic Synchrony lets you join those two webs.

Process an idea until it is done, rewriting it and connecting it to others. Then zoom out, consider the mandala of surrounding expressions. Whatever the previous focus was, the mind can now wander across a convenient list of its neighbors. Or jump to something farther away in the graph, using text search. Or ignore the recorded data altogether, returning to inner stillness.

# too much  ?  transcend the self, transcend as a group

Economists and others will tell you that you are equal to your information: your beliefs, your preferences, your choices. Those things are all rewritable. It's not even difficult: Study yourself, your feelings, your habits, your choices, etc., write some things down, label the relevant topics, read what others have written about those topics -- and you will literally transform your identity.

By sharing those meditations, we can help each other transform as a group, faster and more completely than any individual. [Sharing is optional. Moreover Semantic Synchrony offers a very granular concept of privacy, so sharing is not an all-or-nothing choice; you can wade into it gradually.]
