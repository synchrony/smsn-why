Organize highly-connected writing, with a graph database that feels like a text editor

[Semantic Synchrony](https://github.com/synchrony/smsn/wiki) is a graph database for natural language, a free, open source way of mapping observations and concepts. It is like a normal text editor, except nonlinear, allowing the data to be more connected.

The wiki includes demonstration videos, lots of howtos, and more.
