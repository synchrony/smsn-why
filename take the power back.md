# Take the power back! Build a knowledge graph!

[Semantic Synchrony](http://www.github.com/synchrony/smsn/wiki) is an open-source (free) knowledge graph editor. A knowledge graph is what lets Google, Siri, WolframAlpha, probably the CIA, and others answer questions about the world. Unlike those systems, this one is easy to use -- much easier than Microsoft Word or Minecraft.

Semantic Synchrony lets you share different kinds of things with different kinds of people, or everyone (public), or nobody (private). It integrates with Git, so the entire change history (including authorship) is recorded, and errors can be undone. A small army of us are sharing the [public portions of our knowledge graphs](http://github.com/synchrony/git-smsn/blob/master/our%20public%20knowledge%20graph.md), and we seek more wise contributors.
