# Now anyone can process information nonlinearly!

We already think nonlinearly. Emotions, for instance, are nonlinear: When you see someone make a face, you process (fast, and in no particular order) dozens of related interpretations, motivations, explanations, and responses possible for why they made the face. The brain is a giant, beautiful web of concepts. So is reality itself.

Spoken and written words, however, are linear. Every expression except the last is followed by another.

The reader sometimes feels this, like a bad authority problem. The author chooses the reader's path. In a graph, it's tables of contents all the way down -- and they can overlap and go in circles if you want.

A graph is flexible. Anything can be one step away from anything else. That lets you target the information you care about faster.

A knolwedge graph allows users to write, process, and share nonlinear collections of ideas. It is (1) a powerful discovery tool, (2) a better way to share knowledge, (3) deep soul medicine, (4) easy to use. Next I will address each of those claims.

## Knoledge graphs are a powerful tool for discovery.

To study, to research, to learn: They are to grow a knowledge graph.

When you learn 


## Good for sharing

Those graphs are often private and implicit, like the one in your head. Privacy can be important; certain emotional processes, for instance, might not happen at all without privacy. Semantic Synchrony offers deeply customizable privacy and targeted sharing.

But so much private knowledge is a waste, a tragedy! For everything we want to do -- science, art, compassion, comedy -- sharing our understanding helps immensely. That is why linear writing blew the ancients' minds.


A knowledge graph lets you connect all the knowledge you have collected, or whatever subset you choose, with other peoples'. Josh and I are doing that right now. The installation instructions for Semantic Synchrony describe how you can (optionally) view our shared knowledge graph.

I'm not saying it's all critical information -- one of the things I wrote down today was "the chosen capillary", which I connected to "funny" and "pride".

The genius of a nonlinear collection is that you only see what you care about. If you're not interested in the "funny" node or the "pride" node, you'll never see what I write there. If you like the "funny" node but you don't think what I write is funny, you can exclude my contributions.

With a knowledge graph, the incremental future traversal cost of adding data is low, so more data can be collected and used.

This isn't some technical detail!

## Why it's easy

In a linear collection each expression has a next and a previous one. A graph is similar, only instead of exactly one next and one previous, it can have many next and many previous ones. Each thing is a category that many things can belong to, and each thing can belong to many categories.

That is the way the brain works, because that is the way reality is. For each concept, there is no single natural next concept to consider. Anything could be connected to anything in any way. 

With knowledge graphs, finally, we can express that reality.




# ? nah

The order of words spoken or written is the order of words heard or read.

## Why we need it

### Don't get left behind!
Google, Siri, WolframAlpha and others use knowledge graphs to answer questions about the world.

They tend to hide most of that knowledge jealosly.

We could learn faster. There is stupidity, and it leads to bad decisions. Writing  (linear or nonlinear), reading, organizing and sharing notes is a mechanical study aid that works.

Knowledge is wasted in private.
